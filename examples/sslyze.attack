Background:
  Given "sslyze" is installed
  And the following profile:
    | name     | value      |
    | hostname | google.com |

Scenario: Ensure no anonymous certificates
  When I launch an "sslyze" attack with:
    """
    python <sslyze_path> <hostname>:443
    """
  Then the output should not contain:
    """
    Anon
    """
