Feature: Look for cross site scripting (xss) using arachni against scanme.nmap.org

Scenario: Using arachni, look for cross site scripting and verify no issues are found
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following profile:
     | name                | value                         |
     | url                 | http://scanme.nmap.org        |
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni --checks=xss --scope-directory-depth-limit=1 <url>
  """
  Then the output should contain "With issues: 0"
