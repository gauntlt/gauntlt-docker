Feature: Run garmr scan on a URL

Scenario: Use Garmr to scan a website for the Mozilla opioniated security requirements
  Given "garmr" is installed
  And the following profile:
    | name       | value                      |
    | target_url | http://scanme.nmap.org     |
  When I launch a "garmr" attack with:
    """
    garmr -u <target_url> -o my_garmr_output.xml
    """
  Then it should pass with:
    """
    [Garmr.corechecks.Http200Check] Pass The request returned an HTTP 200 response.
    """
  And the file "my_garmr_output.xml" should not contain XML:

    | testcase[name="Http200Check"] failure    |
