Feature: Check an aplication against its API documentation

Scenario: Using zap-apiscan, load its API documentation and check all it's endpoints with zap
  When I launch a "zap-api-scan" attack on the url "http://petstore.swagger.io/api" whose documentation is available in "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore-expanded.yaml"
  Then the output should contain "FAIL-NEW: 0"
